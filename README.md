PrivateGPT: Your Local Multimodal AI Assistant
PrivateGPT is a robust, locally-hosted AI assistant that enables text and image-based conversation capabilities. Built using Ollama and Streamlit, it provides a secure, private environment for interacting with large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models.

Features
Text-based Conversations: Engage in interactive chats with locally hosted language models.
Image Analysis & Responses: Upload an image and ask questions or request detailed analysis.
Local Model Management:
Download, create, or delete models directly from your system.
Supports multimodal models such as LLaVA and BakLLAVA for image understanding.
Privacy-Focused: Runs entirely on your local machine, ensuring data privacy.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with Streamlit for a clean and intuitive user experience.

Demo
Text-based Chat : Engage in dynamic conversations by selecting from available local models.
Image Analysis : Upload images and interact with models trained for visual understanding.
Model Management : Easily manage models through the Model Management tab:
                        Download existing models.
                        Create custom models.
                        Delete unused models.
